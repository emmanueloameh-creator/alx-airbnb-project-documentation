\# Flowchart – Airbnb Clone Backend Process



This flowchart illustrates one of the core backend processes in the Airbnb Clone system — \*\*User Registration and Authentication\*\*.



\## Description

\- The process starts when a user submits registration details.  

\- The system validates inputs (email, password).  

\- If valid, user data is stored in the database.  

\- A success response is sent, and the user can log in.  

\- If invalid, an error message is returned.



This diagram provides developers with a clear understanding of backend data handling and logical flow.
